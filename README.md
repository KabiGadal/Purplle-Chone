# Purplle Clone(E-Commerece)

Purplle Clone is a Project where you can select a product,
add the product to the cart and do a payment.Then design
is based on the original website Purplle.com. I have tried to 
implement different features from the originall website like
Sign In, Sign Up,Product Filter, Slideshow, Updating Cart etc.
